The Falcon 9 v1.1 is a major redesign of the [Falcon 9 v1.0](term)
launch vehicle. It is substantially taller than the Falcon 9 v1.0 and
features a redesigned first stage engine structure, known as the
[octaweb](term). The later flights of the Falcon 9 v1.1 began to
feature new additions, such as [legs](term:f9-legs) and
[grid fins](term), intended to facilitate recovery of the Falcon 9
first stage.
