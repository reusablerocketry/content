Liquid oxygen is the [liquid](term) form of [oxygen](term). It has a
boiling point of -182.96 Â°C, which makes it a cryogenic
propellant. Because of its very low temperature, it can cause
materials it touches to become extremely brittle. Despite the
difficulty of handling, transporting, and using liquid oxygen, it is
used as an oxidizer for its density.
