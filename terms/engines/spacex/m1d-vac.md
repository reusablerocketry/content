The Merlin 1D Vacuum engine is a heavily modified variant of the
[Merlin 1D](term) engine. It features a 9 foot long niobium skirt to
increase its vacuum performance.

The Merlin 1D Vacuum engine is more powerful than it needs to be for
the [Falcon 9 upper stage](term:f9ft-stage-upper), so it can throttle
down to 39%.

Despite sharing many design elements with the Merlin 1D engine, the
two are not compatible and neither one can be refurbished or modified
into the other.
