The Merlin 1D engine is a [liquid-fuel](term)
[gas-generator-cycle](term) engine that burns [RP-1](term) and
[LOx](term). Unlike its predecessors, the [Merlin 1C](term) and
[Merlin 1A](term), the Merlin 1D [turbopump](term) cannot
[gimbal](term) to provide roll control, as single-engine roll control
is not required for the [Falcon 9](term).

Unlike many first-stage rocket engines, the Merlin 1D can throttle
from 100% to 70%. This [deep throttle](term) capability is used to
limit acceleration during launch, as well as during the
[boostback](term), [entry](term), and [landing](term) burns to provide
more accurate control over the vehicle's [trajectory](term).

During the [CRS-6](term) post-mission
[experimental landing](term:spacex recovery), the [bipropellant](term)
throttle valve experienced increased [static friction](term), and the
[Falcon 9 core](term:f9ft-stage-core) was lost when the engine's
control system induced oscillation in the throttle and/or the engine
gimbal.
