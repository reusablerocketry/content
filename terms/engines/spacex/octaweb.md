The "Octaweb" structure is the arrangement of the nine
[Merlin 1D](term) engines on the [Falcon 9 v1.1](term) and
[Falcon 9 Full Thrust](term) launch vehicles. It features a single
Merlin 1D engine in the center of the vehicle; the eight other engines
are arranged in a ring around it. Since the structure of a rocket is
in the skin, putting the engines closer to the edge of the rocket
makes the thrust structure lighter and simpler, as it no longer has to
transfer forces to the skin from the center of the vehicle.
