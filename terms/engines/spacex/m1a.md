The Merlin 1A engine is a [ablatively-cooled](term)
[liquid-fuel](term) [gas-generator-cycle](term) engine, developed by
[SpaceX](term), that burns [RP-1](term) and [LOx](term). It was used
on the first two flights of the [Falcon 1](term) launch vehicle.

The first flight of the Merlin 1A engine ended in failure when a fuel
leak and the subsequent fire starved the engine of fuel. The second,
and last, flight of the Merlin 1A was a success; however, the Falcon 1
launch vehicle did not reach orbit.
